# Ensemble Programming for Flying Ensembles
## _Combinging Planning with Self-Organization_



On this page, we present video materials accompanying the evaluations performed in the Doctorals Thesis "Ensemble Programming for Flying Ensembles -Combinging Planning with Self-Organization" authored by Oliver Kosak.

The contents of this page are video materials dedicated to the following purposes:

- Evaluations of the concepts from the Multipotent Systems reference architecture using our prototypical reference implementation deployed to  real hardware
- Evaluation of the task allocation mechanism using real hardware
- Evaluations of the Algorithmic Pattern for Trajectory-Based Swarm Behavior (Protease) with NetLogo
- Evaluations of the execution of Ensemble Programs generated within the approach Maple using the prototypical reference implementation of Multipotent Systems


## Evaluations of the concepts from the Multipotent Systems reference architecture using our prototypical reference implementation deployed to  real hardware
- [ScaleX2016] - video on YouTube depicting the field experiment performed during the ScaleX 2016 measuring campaign demonstrating the feasibility of cooperatively transporting a DTS optic-fiber measuring unit with a Multipotent System

## Evaluation of the task allocation mechanism using real hardware
- [SASO2016] - video on YoutTube depicting the mechanism for Self-Organized task allocation deomonstrated at the 10th IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO) 2016
